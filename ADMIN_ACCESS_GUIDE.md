# Admin Panel Access Guide

This guide explains how to access and use the admin panel in Service Charge Watch.

## How to Access the Admin Panel

   - `user_id`: Copy your user ID from the `auth.users` table (after signing up)
   - `email`: Your email address
   - `role`: `admin`
   - Leave `created_at` empty (will auto-fill)

1. First, sign up for an account at http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. Go to your Supabase project dashboard

```sql
-- Find your user_id
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Insert into admin_users table (replace USER_ID with the id from above)
INSERT INTO admin_users (user_id, email, role)
VALUES ('USER_ID_FROM_ABOVE', 'your-email@example.com', 'admin');
```
